# Syntactic Annoations

The CELER data is released along with syntactic annotations (manual annotations for WSJ PTB sentences (v1), and automatic for BLLIP sentences (new to v2)).

The annotations are available in the `annotations` folder, where each file prefix is a list number, and the file contains annotations for the individual regime sentences of that list. List 0 contains annotations of the shared regime sentences.

- `.ids` sentence ids
- `.trees` phrase structure trees (taken from WSJ PTB and BLLIP)
